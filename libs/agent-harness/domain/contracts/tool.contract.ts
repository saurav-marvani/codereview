/**
 * agent-harness — Tool primitive (domain-agnostic).
 *
 * A Tool is a single, self-contained capability the agent can invoke.
 * The core knows nothing about code review: a tool is just a named
 * function with a schema. Domains (code-review, business-rules, docs-qa)
 * supply their own tools or reuse shared tool packs (e.g. repo tools).
 *
 * Design notes (from SOTA research):
 * - Tools must be self-contained, robust to error, unambiguous in use.
 *   Bloated/overlapping tool sets degrade model tool-selection — keep each
 *   tool single-purpose.
 * - Errors are returned as values (ToolResult.isError), never thrown, so
 *   the loop can feed them back to the model instead of crashing.
