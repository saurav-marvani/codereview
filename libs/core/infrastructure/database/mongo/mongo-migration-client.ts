/**
 * Shared Mongo connection for TypeORM migrations and their standalone CLIs.
 *
 * Why it lives here (and stays dependency-free — only the `mongodb` driver, no
 * `@libs`/Nest imports): the migration build (`tsconfig.migrations.json`)
 * compiles this tree in isolation, and the prod migration step
 * (`migration:run:prod`) loads it from `dist/` with no Nest context. Pulling the
 * app's DI graph in here would bloat/break that build.
 *
 * The migration ledger is Postgres (the TypeORM `migrations` table). A Mongo
 * migration is a normal TypeORM migration whose `up()` opens a connection via
 * this helper, does the work, and closes — so Mongo schema/data changes ride
 * the SAME "runs once on boot, pod-locked" mechanism as the SQL migrations.

/**
 * Builds the Mongo URI from the same env the API uses (mongodb.config.loader).
 * Prefers a full URI; otherwise assembles host/port/creds with the SAME
 * `connection-string` builder + protocol rule as the runtime app
 * (`MongooseFactory.createMongooseOptions`): a numeric `API_MG_DB_PORT`
 * → `mongodb://host:port`; anything else (empty, `''`, non-numeric — e.g.
 * Atlas via SSM) → `mongodb+srv://host` (SRV supplies the port).
 *
 * Keeping this in lock-step with the app matters because self-hosted customers
 * only test what boots the API. If a client's env boots the app it must also
 * boot migrations — we shouldn't have two independent URI dialects to keep in
 * sync.
