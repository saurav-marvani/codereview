 *
 *   - `pull-request.closed` is emitted by the webhook PR handlers, which
 *     execute in the WORKER (the webhook queue consumer lives there),
 *     while its listeners — KodyRulesSyncListener (repo rule-file sync)
 *     and CentralizedConfigSyncListener — are registered in the API
 *     module tree. Result: PR-driven rule sync and centralized-config
 *     sync silently never ran on self-hosted.
 *   - `pr-execution.updated` is emitted by AutomationExecutionService in
 *     the review pipeline (worker) and consumed by the API's SSE endpoint
 *     (/pull-requests/executions/events). Result: the UI's live execution
 *     status only ever showed heartbeats.
 *
 * Registering the listener modules in the worker is not viable: the
 * KodyRules module graph deadlocks the worker's Nest boot (forwardRef
 * cycles), and the SSE consumer is an HTTP endpoint that must live in
 * the API regardless.

 * Re-emitted payloads carry `__kodusBridged` so the forwarder ignores
