/**
 * code-review (domain) — provider fallback for the v5 agent loop.
 *
 * The agent harness resolves ONE model and runs; unlike the v2 legacy flow
 * (LangChain `.withFallbacks`), it has no built-in retry against a second
 * provider. This wrapper gives the agent providers the same resilience the org
 * already expects from its BYOK `fallback` config: run the `main` model, and if
 * it fails, retry ONCE against `fallback`.
 *
 * "Fails" means EITHER:
 *   - a thrown provider/API error (e.g. preflight, or an error that escapes the
 *     harness), OR
 *   - a non-throwing FAILURE RESULT. The agent harness is "observable by
 *     construction": a model/provider throw inside the loop is caught and
 *     turned into an error-status result (finishReason 'error') instead of a
 *     bare exception. Verified end-to-end — a bogus main model produced
 *     "0 suggestions, 0 failures" and never threw. So a throw-only check would
 *     silently miss the main failure and never reach the fallback. `isFailure`
 *     detects that swallowed error so the fallback still fires.
 *
 * Budget exhaustion returns finishReason 'timeout' (not 'error'), so callers'
 * `isFailure` must NOT treat it as a failure — retrying a full loop after a
 * 30-min timeout would just double the latency.
