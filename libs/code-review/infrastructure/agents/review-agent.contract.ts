/**
 * code-review — the shared CONTRACTS for a review-agent run: the input, output,

 * (prompt-builder, batch-runner, model-factory, …) and the pipeline stage all
 * speak. Lives here (neutral home) rather than inside the provider class so the
 * collaborators don't have to import their vocabulary from the God class they
 * were extracted from (no type cycle).
 *
 * These are code-review domain shapes (changedFiles, kodyRules, remoteCommands,
 * coverage…), NOT harness primitives — the harness must never depend on them.
 *
 * `ReviewAgentInput` is composed from cohesive sub-interfaces (ISP): each
 * collaborator can depend on the narrow slice it needs (e.g.
